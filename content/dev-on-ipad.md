The apps I currently use

- Working Copy app
- Vercel/Netlify for deployment

This is not as fast as working locally on a computer, but when I want to just update the content and see if it looks good, I could change content using Working Copy and push a commit, all from an [[iPad]]. It could be a new branch if you don't want to update the production deployment directly. Vercel and Netlify do a great job of rebuilt and deploying the projects when we push commits to the repositories.

I tried Codesandbox on iPad's Safari, but it not there yet. Honestly it's too small on my 11" iPad to have code and browser open at the same time. And it is not very useable on the iPad.

Hoping for a future where I get a local command line (or a Terminal) on iPad. ðŸ¤ž

## Another option

You can use something like Blink Shell app to SSH on to a computer on cloud. Clone your repos on it and compile.
